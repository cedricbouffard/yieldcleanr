\title{Clean Yield Data with Deletion Tracking}
\usage{
clean_yield_with_tracking(
  file_path,
  metrique = TRUE,
  polygon = TRUE,
  params = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{Path to input file (txt/csv format)}

\item{metrique}{TRUE for metric units (kg/ha), FALSE for imperial (bu/acre)}

\item{polygon}{TRUE for SF polygon output, FALSE for tibble output}

\item{params}{List of AYCE parameters (see details)}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item data_clean: Cleaned data as tibble or SF object
\item deletions: Data frame of deleted points with reasons
\item stats: Summary statistics
}
}
\description{
Similar to clean_yield() but tracks which points are removed at each filtering step
and the reason for deletion. Useful for visualization and debugging.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
result <- clean_yield_with_tracking("data.txt", metrique = TRUE, polygon = TRUE)
print(result$stats)
head(result$deletions)
}
}
